## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Button

With `st.download_button` you can now seamlessly use download functionality both locally and on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud). 

Check out the radio buttons in the sidebar to play with some samples and head over to [the blog](https://blog.streamlit.io/0-88-0-release-notes/) for more info!

## üß© Other notable updates

Below are some other notable updates on this release:

- üõë We made changes to improve the redacted exception experience on Streamlit Cloud. When `client.showErrorDetails=true`  exceptions display the Error Type and the Traceback, but redact the actual error text to prevent data leaks. [[3713](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3713)]
- üñ•Ô∏è Since Macs are set to verify SSL in Python, if certificates aren't installed, a `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error propagates. We removed HTTPS in order to solve this issue. [[3744](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3744)]
- üîë Integers can now also be used as keys in widget declarations. This helps community members who use integers for keys. This change updates type annotations to allow it, and ensures integer keys are converted to strings. [[3697](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3697)]
