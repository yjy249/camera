**Notable Changes**

- ðŸ•³ [`st.empty`](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.75.0/api.html#streamlit.empty)
previously would clear the component at the end of the script. It has now been
updated to clear the component instantly.
- ðŸ›¹ Previously in wide mode, we had thin margins around the webpage. This has
now been increased to provide a better visual experience
