### New Features

- âŒ— Introducing new layout options for Streamlit! Move aside, vertical layout.
Make a little space for... horizontal layout! Check out our
[blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-new-layout-options-for-streamlit).
- ðŸ’¾ File uploader redesigned with new functionality for multiple files uploads
and better support for working with uploaded files. This may cause breaking
changes. Please see the new api in our
[documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.68.0/api.html#streamlit.file_uploader)


### Notable Changes

- ðŸŽˆ `st.balloon` has gotten a facelift with nicer balloons and smoother animations.
- ðŸš¨ Breaking Change: Following the deprecation of `st.deck_gl_chart` in
January 2020, we have now removed the API completely. Please use
`st.pydeck_chart` instead.
- ðŸš¨ Breaking Change: Following the deprecation of `width` and `height` for
`st.altair_chart`, `st.graphviz_chart`, `st.plotly_chart`, and
`st.vega_lite_chart` in January 2020, we have now removed the args completely.
 Please set the width and height in the respective charting library.
