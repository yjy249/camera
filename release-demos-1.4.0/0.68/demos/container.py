        `st.beta_container` is a building block that helps you organize your app.
        Just like `st.empty`, `st.beta_container` lets you set aside some space, and
        then later write things to it out of order. But while subsequent calls to
        the same `st.empty` replace the item inside it, subsequent calls to the
        same `st.beta_container` append to it. This works just like the
        `st.sidebar` you've come to know and love.
